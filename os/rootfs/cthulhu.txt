“Children will always be afraid of the dark,
and men with minds sensitive to hereditary
impulse will always tremble at the thought
of the hidden and fathomless worlds of strange
life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the
stars, or press hideously upon our own globe in
unholy dimensions which only the dead and the
moonstruck can glimpse.”
